// bundle three attribute as a node data
// First attribute is color, "0" means black, "1" means red , NIL is also "0", "-1" means no data
// Second attribute is key, "0" means NIL, "1"~"999" means data,  "-1" means no data
// Third attribute is size, for Dynamic Order Statistics, "0" means NIL , "-1" means no data
//
// for example,
// if tree[0] is "256" says that the array size is 256
//
// if tree[1] is "1" says that the place of 1 is a red node
//
// if tree[2] is "5" says that the place of 1 is key of 5
//
// if tree[8] is "-1" says that the place of 3 has nothing
//
// if tree[14] is "0" says that the place of 5 is a node of NIL
//
// if tree[19] is "66" says that the place of 7 is key of 66
